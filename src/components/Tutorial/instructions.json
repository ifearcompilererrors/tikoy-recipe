Just follow the recipe <a target='__blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SEp4UfHgbE&t=22s'>here</a>. Mix those ingredients up in a bowl, chill it in the fridge, and ta-da! You'll have your own rice cake just like this one.<br/><br/> Let's take it out of the package and bake it into something delicious!",
  "1": "Step one: steam the rice cake. I put the rice cake in this handy pan and set the steamer to medium-high so it's ready to go. Can you put the pan in the pot and cover it with the lid?<br/><br/> By the way, I wrapped the lid in a cheesecloth so the condensed water doesn't drip onto the mixture. You'll thank me later!",
  "2": "While we wait for the cake to steam for 45 minutes, let's prepare the toppings and filling. This time, I'll let you choose your ingredients! What do you want to coat our tikoy in?",
  "3": "Excellent choice. What do you want to fill your tikoy with?",
  "4": "Sounds like our cake is done! Take it out and let it cool.",
  "5": "Cool! Now flatten out the rice cake and spread your filling out in a thick line near the edge.",
  "6": "Fold the rice cake over the filling just enough to make a small roll. Then, separate the rolled portion, and cut it into smaller pieces.",
  "7": "Last but not least, coat your tikoy. Then we're done!",
  "8": "Masarap!<br/>Delicious!"
